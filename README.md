# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Clud is marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

    1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

    2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may leao a financial loss    for the company.

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

The data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

We have performed EDA to get insights from given data. Steps performed as below:
    1. Data Understanding
    2. Data Cleaning
    3. Data Analysis (EDA)
        3.1 Univariate Analysis
        3.2 Bivariate Analysis
        3.3 Multivariate Analysis
